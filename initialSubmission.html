    <p>Authors must adhere to the IEEE Conference paper format. Draft version of papers should be submitted for review before the <strong>Full Paper Submission Deadline</strong>.

Up to two (2) extra pages are  permissible with an <strong>extra fee</strong>  paid at registration time. Total file size must not exceed 2 MB. <br>

    <p>Prospective authors should only submit original  work that has neither appeared elsewhere for publication, nor is under review  for another refereed publication. The Conference will use the CrossCheck automated screening system to help verify originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to millions of articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE’s publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, then disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE. </p>


    <p><strong>Accepted and presented</strong> papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings, which will be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® online Digital Library and EI Compendex database. <br>
